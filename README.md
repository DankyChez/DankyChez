  Aimo Koivunen is a Finnish WW2 soldier who took massive overdose of Pervitin (methamphetamine) and was lost in the vast wilderness of Lapland for two weeks during the freezing winter of 1944. ESCAPED from the soviets 3 times, burnt a house in the countryside down and used it for WARMTH, and LIVED.
